*What is Bullet Journaling?*

A bullet journal is a method of personal organization developed by digital product designer Ryder Carroll. The system organizes scheduling, reminders, to-do lists, brainstorming, allows you to easily track things in a highly visual and organized format, and other organizational tasks into a single notebook.
