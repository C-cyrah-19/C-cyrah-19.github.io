*What is Bullet Journaling?*

A bullet journal is a method of personal organization developed by digital product designer Ryder Carroll. The system organizes scheduling, reminders, to-do lists, brainstorming, allows you to easily track things in a highly visual and organized format, and other organizational tasks into a single notebook.

  *Why is it useful?*
  
  It is useful because bullet journals, also called BuJo for short, are a type of journal that serves as both a planner and a diary. As a planner, they track both short-term and long-term goals. As a diary, it can be used to quickly log your thoughts and feelings, making them a great form of self-care.
